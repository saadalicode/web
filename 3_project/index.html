    <p>Dear Dr. Mansoor,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my growing
      concern about the security measures currently in place at our college. As
      a dedicated student, I deeply value the safe and supportive environment
      that our institution strives to provide. However, recent incidents on
      campus have raised significant apprehensions among the student body
      regarding our overall security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past few weeks, there have been reports of unauthorized
      individuals gaining access to our campus facilities. Additionally, several
      students, including myself, have observed areas around the campus where
      lighting is inadequate, making these spots potentially dangerous during
      the evening hours. These issues have understandably led to a heightened
      sense of vulnerability among students.
    </p>

    <p>
      I kindly request a meeting with you or the appropriate security personnel
      to discuss these concerns and potential solutions further. I am confident
      that, together, we can create a more secure and reassuring environment for
      everyone at college.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt
      response.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yours sincerely,
      <br />

      Jameel Shah,
      <br />
